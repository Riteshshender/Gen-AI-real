The Transformer is a novel neural network architecture designed for sequence transduction tasks, relying solely on attention mechanisms instead of recurrent or convolutional networks. This approach improves parallelization and significantly reduces training time. In experiments, the Transformer achieved superior results in machine translation tasks, with a BLEU score of 28.4 for English-to-German and 41.8 for English-to-French, outperforming previous models by a notable margin. Additionally, the Transformer demonstrated its versatility by effectively handling English constituency parsing tasks, proving its generalization capability across different types of language processing tasks.
